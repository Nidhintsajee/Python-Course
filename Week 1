 Lecture 1 - Introduction to Computation
 ---------------------------------------
*An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm. 
*A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.
*Computer Science is not the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs.
*The two things every computer can do are:Perform calculations ,Remember the results.
*Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.
*Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.
*A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a
starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.
*A stored program computer is not designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a 
missile.
*A fixed program computer is not designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read 
into it.
*A program counter points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program. 
*The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
*In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must not be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
*Determines whether a string is legal -> Syntax 
*Determines whether a string has meaning -> Static semantics  
*Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence -> Semantics
>>> a = 3
>>> a + 2.0 
 
float - answer is 5.0

 >>> a = a + 1.0
>>> a 
 
float - answer is 4.0   
 >>> a = 3
>>> b
 
NoneType -  answer error  
 >>> a == 5.0
>>> a 
 
int - answer is 3  
 >>> b = 10
>>> c = b > 9
>>> c 
 
bool - answer is True
"a" + "bc"

"abc"  
3 * "bc"

"bcbcbc"
"3" * "bc"

> str1 = 'hello'
> str2 = ','
> str3 = 'world'
Note: The Python 'in' operator
str1

string -  answer is 'hello'

str1[0]

string -  answer is h
str1[1]

string -  answer is e
str1[-1]

string -  answer is o 
len(str1)

int -  answer is 5

str1[len(str1)]

NoneType -  answer is error
str1 + str2 + str3

string -  answer is 'hello,world'
str1 + str2 + ' ' + str3

string -  answer is 'hello, world'
str3 * 3

string -  answer is 'worldworldworld'
   
'hello' == str1

boolean - answer is True
   
'HELLO' == str1

boolean -  answer is False
   
'a' in str3

boolean -  answer is False
 
 str4 = str1 + str3
'low' in str4
					
boolean -  answer is True

str3[1:3]

string -  answer is or
 
str3[:3]

string - answer is wor
 
str3[:-1]

string - answer is worl

str1[1:]

 string - answer is ello
 
str4[1:9]

string -  answer is elloworl
  
str4[1:9:2]
 
string -  answer is elwr

str4[::-1]

string -  answer is dlrowolleh
